  -Cookie's comments for learning purposes
  -{{}} is syntax for text
  -adding an <a> [title] makes the title's name a link to another page 
  -On the <p> element, use an *ngIf directive so that Angular only creates the <p> element if the current product has a description
  -Bind the button's click event to the share() method (in product-list.component.ts). Event binding uses a set of parentheses, ( ), around the event, as in the following <button> element

  A component class that handles data and functionality. In the previous section, the product data and the share() method in the component class handle data and functionality, respectively.
An HTML template that determines the UI. In the previous section, the product list's HTML template displays the name, description, and a "Share" button for each product.
Component-specific styles that define the look and feel. Though product list does not define any styles, this is where component CSS resides.
